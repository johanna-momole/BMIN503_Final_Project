# HPV Vaccination Coverage Analysis

## Project Overview

This project investigates the factors influencing HPV vaccination coverage among children aged 9â€“17 in the United States, focusing on how social determinants of health (SDOH) such as insurance status, income level, urbanization, and disability status may impact vaccination rates. The goal is to use predictive modeling and statistical analysis to identify key predictors of lower vaccination coverage, providing insights for targeted public health interventions to increase HPV vaccine uptake.

## Repository Structure

-   **Data**: This folder (or link to data source) contains the dataset, "NCHS Data Brief No. 495," which includes HPV vaccination coverage data and relevant demographic and socioeconomic variables.

-   **Methods**: Outlines the data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), geographic analysis, and predictive modeling steps used to analyze the dataset.

-   **Results**: Summarizes the findings, including significant predictors of vaccination coverage and insights into areas for improvement in vaccination rates.

## Usage

To run the analysis, clone this repository and open it as an RStudio Project. The primary analyses are within the `.qmd` file, which can be rendered to HTML.

## Future Work

The final version will include a complete analysis report with additional visualizations and model interpretations.
